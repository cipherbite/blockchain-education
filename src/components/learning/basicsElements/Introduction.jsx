    explanation:
      "Think of blockchain as a digital ledger book that's copied across many computers. Each 'page' (block) contains a list of transactions. Once a page is filled and added to the book, it can't be changed or removed. This ensures that all transactions are permanent and can be verified by anyone.",

    title: "How Does It Work?",
    content:
      "Chain of cryptographically linked blocks containing transactions, resistant to tampering.",
    explanation:
      "Each block contains a unique code (hash) of the previous block, creating a chain. If someone tries to alter a block, it changes this code, breaking the chain. This makes it nearly impossible to tamper with the history of transactions without being detected.",
  },
  {
    icon: Server,
    title: "Decentralization",
    content:
      "Distributes data across network nodes, enhancing security and reducing single points of failure.",
    explanation:
      "Instead of having one central server (like a bank), blockchain spreads information across many computers. This means there's no single point that can be hacked or shut down, making the system more resilient and harder to attack.",
  },
  {
    icon: Users,
    title: "Consensus Mechanisms",
    content:
      "Algorithms ensuring network-wide agreement on the ledger state, preventing fraud.",
    explanation:
      "Before a new block is added, computers in the network must agree it's valid. It's like a voting system where the majority must approve any change. This prevents any single entity from manipulating the blockchain.",
  },
  {
    icon: BookOpen,
    title: "Smart Contracts",
    content:
      "Self-executing contracts automating processes and enabling complex, condition-based transactions.",
    explanation:
      "Imagine a vending machine that not only dispenses snacks but can handle complex deals. Smart contracts are like that - they automatically execute actions when certain conditions are met, without needing a middleman.",
  },
  {
    icon: AlertCircle,
    title: "Challenges",
    content:
      "Includes scalability, energy consumption, regulatory uncertainties, and adoption barriers.",
    explanation:
      "As more people use blockchain, it can slow down (scalability issue). Some blockchains use a lot of energy. There's also confusion about how to regulate this new technology, and many people still don't understand or trust it.",
  },
  {
    icon: Key,
    title: "Cryptography in Blockchain",
    content:
      "Uses advanced mathematical techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units.",
    explanation:
      "Cryptography in blockchain is like a super-secure lock system. It ensures that only the rightful owner can access their assets, verifies the authenticity of transactions, and helps create new 'coins' in a controlled manner.",
  },
  {
    icon: Shield,

    content:
      "Combines cryptography, decentralization, and consensus to create a highly secure system.",
    explanation:

          How This Simulator Works
        </h4>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          This simulator demonstrates the basic process of creating new blocks
          in a blockchain:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-300 space-y-2">
          <li>Click "Mine New Block" to start the mining process.</li>
          <li>
            The system will try different "nonce" values (you'll see this number
            increasing rapidly).
          </li>
          <li>
            When a valid "nonce" is found (simulated here with a 10% chance each
            try), a new block is created.
          </li>
          <li>
            The new block contains a unique hash, timestamp, and the successful
            nonce value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blocks are added to the chain, with each new block pointing to the
            previous one (shown by the arrows).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mt-4">
          In a real blockchain, mining involves solving complex mathematical
          problems. This process ensures that adding new blocks requires
          computational work, making it difficult to tamper with the
          blockchain's history.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 italic mt-4">
        Click 'Mine New Block' to simulate adding a new block to the blockchain.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default React.memo(BlockchainSimulator);
