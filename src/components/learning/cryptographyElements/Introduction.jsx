          Why Cryptography Matters
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-300">
          In the era of digital transformation, cryptography provides the
          essential layer of trust for secure online interactions. It enables
          privacy, secure communication, and verifiable transactions â€“ the
          cornerstones of blockchain technology. Cryptography is key to
          protecting personal data, financial transactions, and online
          communication. In the context of blockchain, cryptography enables the
          creation of decentralized systems resistant to tampering and
          censorship, opening the door to new models of governance and
          collaboration in the digital space.
